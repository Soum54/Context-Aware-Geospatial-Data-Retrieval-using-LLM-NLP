# Context-Aware-Geospatial-Data-Retrieval-using-LLM-NLP

This project uses advanced NLP techniques to extract geospatial entities from text and summarize the information using OpenAI's GPT-4 model. The project demonstrates how to use spaCy for named entity recognition, geopy for geocoding, and OpenAI's GPT-4 for summarization.

## Features

- Named Entity Recognition (NER) using spaCy
- Geocoding locations using Nominatim and LocationIQ
- Summarizing geospatial information using OpenAI's GPT-4

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- OpenAI API key
- LocationIQ API key
